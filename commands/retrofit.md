# /retrofit

Use the `retrofitting-codebases` skill to analyze existing code.

**Arguments:** optional feature name to focus on

Examples:
- `/retrofit` → starts with discovery phase (surveys whole codebase)
- `/retrofit password-reset` → jumps to archaeology for that feature

Outputs go to `.retrofit/` directory.
